Technical Architecture
Frontend
Hybrid Rendering Strategy
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - User/session-specific data preloaded on initial page load
Static Site Generation (SSG) - Public pages and layouts pre-rendered at build time
Client-Side Hydration - Seamless transition from server-rendered to interactive state
Advanced State Management
Model-Based Context Providers - Separate React context providers for each data model (tasks, projects, comments)
SSR-to-Client State Bridge - Server props initialize in-memory object arrays via React state hooks
Memory-Based Operations - All filtering, sorting, and view transformations handled client-side for instant responsiveness
Derived View States - Dynamic view generation from cached object arrays without additional API calls
Real-Time Updates
Optimistic UI Updates - Instant visual feedback with background API synchronization
Reactive State Propagation - Changes automatically cascade across all relevant views and components
Granular Re-rendering - Context-aware updates prevent unnecessary component refreshes
Backend
API Architecture
RESTful API Design - Comprehensive endpoints for all CRUD operations across data models with Next.js App Router API routes
Session-Aware Data Loading - User-specific data preloading for SSR initialization via dedicated query functions
Unified Endpoint Strategy - Flexible APIs (e.g., comments endpoint serves both project comments and personal notes via filtering)
Type-Safe API Layer - Prisma-generated types ensure end-to-end type safety from database to client

Database & ORM
Prisma ORM Integration - Schema-first development with automatic type generation and query inference
Query Function Architecture - Centralized data fetching logic in /lib/queries with exported TypeScript types
Relational Database Schema - Normalized PostgreSQL structure for tasks, projects, comments, and user relationships
Connection Pooling - Optimized database connections via Neon's pooled and direct connection options
Transaction Management - Atomic operations for data consistency across related models
Authentication & Security
NextAuth.js Integration - Google OAuth with session management and route protection
User-Scoped Data Access - All queries automatically filtered by authenticated user context
Secure API Routes - Session validation on all data endpoints
Performance & Optimization
Query Optimization - Strategic use of Prisma's include and select for efficient data fetching
Type Inference Pattern - Eliminates type drift by deriving TypeScript types directly from Prisma queries
Batch Operations - Specialized endpoints for bulk actions (e.g., batch-delete-project-comments)
Minimal API Surface - Reusable endpoints reduce code duplication and maintenance overhead
Performance Optimizations
Client-Side Performance
Zero-Latency Interactions - In-memory state operations eliminate loading states for common actions
Efficient Data Transformation - Client-side filtering and sorting of pre-loaded datasets
Minimal API Requests - Views generated from cached data reduce server round-trips
Rendering Performance
Strategic Hydration - Server-rendered content with selective client-side enhancement
Component Optimization - Minimal DOM manipulation through efficient React patterns
Memory Management - Intelligent caching layer balances performance with memory usage
