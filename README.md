## Technical Highlights

While project management apps are common, this platform focuses on developing high performance, detailed & engaging UX and robust architecture leveraging SSR preloading with seamless client-state hydration. It achieves ~50ms client-side route transitions without loading states, using custom in-memory state management and optimistic UI updates. A hybrid SSR/CSR setup ensures fast initial loads and snappy interactivity.

State is handled through a custom model-driven system built with React Context API and TypeScript, with a server-to-client bridge to eliminate hydration mismatches. Changes are held in memory for instant responsiveness and synced to the backend in the background. State flows cleanly and instantly across views, keeping everything in sync.

The full-stack layer includes end-to-end type safety using Prisma, scoped data loading per session, and a foundation for future team workflows building on the current real-time project comment system. Authentication is handled through Google OAuth, using a production-ready setup.

## API Endpoints

The application provides REST-like endpoints for:

- **Tasks:** Create, update, delete, assign, prioritize, and search

- **Authentication:** Google OAuth via NextAuth.js
- **Comments/Notes:** Project comments and personal notes (unified endpoint with projectId filtering)

## Architecture

### Frontend

#### Hybrid Rendering Strategy

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - User/session-specific data preloaded on initial page load
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Public pages and layouts pre-rendered at build time
- **Client-Side Hydration** - Seamless transition from server-rendered to interactive state

#### Advanced State Management

- **Model-Based Context Providers** - Separate React context providers for each data model (tasks, projects, comments)
- **SSR-to-Client State Bridge** - Server props initialize in-memory object arrays via React state hooks
- **Memory-Based Operations** - All filtering, sorting, and view transformations handled client-side for instant responsiveness
- **Derived View States** - Dynamic view generation from cached object arrays without additional API calls

#### Real-Time Updates

- **Optimistic UI Updates** - Instant visual feedback with background API synchronization
- **Reactive State Propagation** - Changes automatically cascade across all relevant views and components
- **Granular Re-rendering** - Context-aware updates prevent unnecessary component refreshes

### Backend

#### API Architecture

- **RESTful API Design** - Comprehensive endpoints for all CRUD operations across data models with Next.js App Router API routes
- **Session-Aware Data Loading** - User-specific data preloading for SSR initialization via dedicated query functions
- **Unified Endpoint Strategy** - Flexible APIs (e.g., comments endpoint serves both project comments and personal notes via filtering)
- **Type-Safe API Layer** - Prisma-generated types ensure end-to-end type safety from database to client

#### Database & ORM

- **Prisma ORM Integration** - Schema-first development with automatic type generation and query inference
- **Query Function Architecture** - Centralized data fetching logic in /lib/queries with exported TypeScript types
- **Relational Database Schema** - Normalized PostgreSQL structure for tasks, projects, comments, and user relationships
- **Connection Pooling** - Optimized database connections via Neon's pooled and direct connection options
- **Transaction Management** - Atomic operations for data consistency across related models

#### Authentication & Security

- **NextAuth.js Integration** - Google OAuth with session management and route protection
- **User-Scoped Data Access** - All queries automatically filtered by authenticated user context
- **Secure API Routes** - Session validation on all data endpoints

#### Performance & Optimization

- **Query Optimization** - Strategic use of Prisma's include and select for efficient data fetching
- **Type Inference Pattern** - Eliminates type drift by deriving TypeScript types directly from Prisma queries
- **Batch Operations** - Specialized endpoints for bulk actions (e.g., batch-delete-project-comments)
- **Minimal API Surface** - Reusable endpoints reduce code duplication and maintenance overhead

## Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side Performance

- **Zero-Latency Interactions** - In-memory state operations eliminate loading states for common actions
- **Efficient Data Transformation** - Client-side filtering and sorting of pre-loaded datasets
- **Minimal API Requests** - Views generated from cached data reduce server round-trips

### Rendering Performance

- **Strategic Hydration** - Server-rendered content with selective client-side enhancement
- **Component Optimization** - Minimal DOM manipulation through efficient React patterns
- **Memory Management** - Intelligent caching layer balances performance with memory usage
